Case 1:

Fundamental balanced voltages withy a magnitude of 230 V RMS per phase.

At 0.4 sec, frequency changes to 52 Hz from 50 Hz. At 0.5 sec, it is again changed to 48 Hz. Again at 0.6 sec, it is changed to 100 Hz.


Case 2:

At 0.4 sec fundamental balanced voltages are changed to fundamental balanced sag of 0.5 pu.
At 0.5 sec, fundamental unbalanced sag Vsa = 0.5 pu and others at 1 pu is created
At 0.6 sec, fundamental balanced swell Vs = 1.2 pu is created
At 0.7 sec, fundamental unbalanced swell Vsa = 1.2 pu and others at 1 pu is created
At 0.8 sec, Harmonic voltages with a THD of is created
At 0.9 sec, Harmonic balanced sag Vs = 0.5 pu is created; THD is 
At 1 sec, Harmonic unbalanced sag Vsa = 0.5 pu and others at 1 pu is created; THD is
At 1.1 sec, Harmonic balanced swell Vs = 1.2 pu is created; THD is
At 1.2 sec, Harmonic unbalanced swell Vsa = 1.2 pu and others at 1 pu is created; THD is


Case 3:

At 0.4 sec, fundamental balanced voltages are transitioned to fundamental balanced voltages with a phase angle jump of 180 degrees.
At 0.8 sec, 100 V DC offset is added to the fundamental balanced voltages
At 0.9 sec, voltage distortions are created.
